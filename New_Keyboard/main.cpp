/*{Question:

Question (Moderate Difficulty):

Write a C++ program that takes a sentence as input and performs the following tasks using vectors and <cctype> functions:

Extract all words from the sentence (a word is a sequence of alphabetic characters).

Convert each word to lowercase.

Store the words in a vector.

Print the unique words in alphabetical order.

Constraints:

Use only procedural programming (no classes/objects).

Use std::vector, <cctype> (e.g. isalpha, tolower), and basic STL functions only.*/

char sentence_[1000]{0};

int main (){
    //Declaaration
    cout<<"Please enter the setence: "<<endl;
